### debug.sc:
#### By Xendergo
  Adds a debug() function which is equivalent to print(), but color codes things by type. Helpful for distinguishing between null & 'null', or maps, nbts, and stringified nbts
  debug() can take as many arguments as you want and it will print all of them seperated by spaces

  The colors used are:
  null - purple
  number - blue
  string - orange
  list - yellow
  map - red
  iterator - Darker yellow
  function - magenta
  task - grey
  block - green
  entity - Darker red
  nbt - cyan
  text - Unchanged, usually formatted already
