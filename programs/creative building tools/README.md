### cover.sc
### By Firigion

Lets you cover a set of blocks with a set of other blocks for ease of spawnproofing a decorative build. To use it, put the block to cover in your offhand and the block to cover it with in your main hand. To do a bunch of diferent blocks at a time, create pairs by palcing a shulker box in the main hand and another one in the off hand. Pairs will be created from matching slots in the boxes. For more info, see [this](https://github.com/Firigion/scarpets#cover).

### soft_replace.sc
### By Firigion

Lets you replace blocks in an area with other blocks, preserving their block properties. This way, you can create a beatutiful build out of slabs, stairs and log blocks and midway through the design process, change your pallette. See [here](https://github.com/Firigion/scarpets#soft-replace) for more info on how to use it.
